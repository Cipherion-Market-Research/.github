## Applied Research Projects
<div align="justify"> 

**2024‚ÄìCurrent, CipheX Capital Ecosystem**: CipheX is an open capital network that provides users with access to autonomous, noncustodial digital asset portfolio management through its proprietary execution system, Alpha CPX. Designed to operate without intermediaries, Alpha CPX empowers individuals to maintain full control over their assets while benefiting from institutional-grade market execution, real-time risk adjustment, and intelligent trade automation.

**2022‚ÄìCurrent, Alpha Centurion Network (Alpha CPX):**: Alpha CPX is a fully autonomous, non-custodial portfolio management platform that delivers institutional-grade performance to everyday consumers. It operates without centralized control, using advanced AI models and real-time market execution strategies to optimize asset performance, manage risk, and adapt dynamically to evolving market conditions.

**2022‚Äì2024, CPX Market Centurions**: Autonomous, self-learning trading agents utilize advanced algorithms and market predictability analytics to execute trades with precision while minimizing risk in volatile digital asset markets. These agents were integrated into Alpha CPX in 2024, enhancing its ability to adapt in real time, identify optimal entry and exit points, and maintain performance consistency for users across shifting market conditions.

**2020‚Äì2022, Abacus EMS**: A proprietary arbitrage execution engine and the foundational predecessor to several core features of the CPX Market Centurions. Designed to identify and capitalize on price inefficiencies across fragmented digital asset markets, Abacus EMS pioneered high-speed trade routing, latency optimization, and cross-market arbitrage logic that now informs the adaptive strategies within Alpha CPX‚Äôs autonomous execution framework.

**2016‚Äì2019, Hypatia Data Intelligence**: Hypatia is a sophisticated data analytics and modeling system built to detect and interpret complex inefficient market patterns, enhancing the predictive targeting of the Abacus EMS arbitrage engine. As the predecessor to the CPX Framework, now the AI core of Alpha CPX, it established the foundation for signal extraction, anomaly detection, and forecasting in volatile markets.

## Intellectual Properties 
<div align="justify"> 

The name CipheX is derived from ‚ÄúCipher,‚Äù representing encrypted intelligence, while the ‚ÄúX‚Äù signifies exponential capability. CPX, is short for Capital Predictive eXecution, the proprietary algorithmic framework powering all market strategies within the Alpha Centurion Network (Alpha CPX).

**2024 CPX Framework.**: The CPX Framework is Alpha CPX‚Äôs proprietary AI core, enabling real-time signal analysis, predictive modeling, and autonomous trade execution. It identifies opportunities, manages risk, and adapts to market conditions, delivering institutional-grade performance while preserving noncustodial user control across traditional and digital asset markets.

**2023 Adaptive Target Identification & Market Intelligence.**: This framework combines Concentric Economics, Behavioral Analytics, and MEV research to detect high-probability trade opportunities. It dynamically analyzes capital flows, participant behavior, and value-extractive risks to generate precise, real-time trading signals across fragmented and volatile digital asset and traditional markets.

**2021 Natural Capital & Modern Commodities.**: Explores fractal volatility opportunities arising from flawed environmental valuation and pricing models as traditional markets integrate voluntary carbon credits and ESG-linked supply chains into futures and commodities. These inefficiencies create dislocations exploitable through predictive modeling across evolving asset classes.

**2018 Concentric Economics & Emerging Hyper Volatilities.**: Concentric Economics analyzes how capital rotates between asset classes, revealing patterns of emerging hyper volatility as traditional markets respond to the growth of digital assets. This approach uncovers structural imbalances, liquidity dislocations, and behavioral shifts driving amplified volatility across interconnected financial systems.
